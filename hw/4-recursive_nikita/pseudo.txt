Soooooo it's the last pseudo-code huh?
I will be as concise as possible since you are probably not enjoying reading what 
I wrote :)
The first function I defined is used to clean the input removing the lines with
'#' and by splitting each instruction in four words by replacing the lower 
letters with spaces and putting them in a list.

At this point I create a dictionary (if there are instructions, otherwise I return
an empty set) that maps to every couple of city-clue the respective
couples of city-secret.

Now everything is set to start looking for secrets, I evaluate before-hand 
the len of the clues to avoid evaluating at every call of the function.

So the recursion starts with the base case that checks if the index equals to the length
of the list of the clues, if so I return a set with a tuple (secret.strip(), city). Then for every instruction in the values of that specific city,
secret; I update a the string of the secret and then I update the total set calling
the recursion again.
Then I simply return the total set

Hope this was in any way useful!
Have a good day!! :))
